            <h3>Places I've lived:</h3>
                <p>I was born in Hawaii. Moved to MI because that's where my mom is from. Moved back to Hawaii cause it was necessary for sanity...moved to Honolulu for college. Moved to NY to work with a friend. Moved to ATX to complete college courses through National Student Exchange.
